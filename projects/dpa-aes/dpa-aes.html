	<h2>About Project</h2>
	<p>
		Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the standard encryption used all over the world and is adopted by the United States. While the encryption algorithm is strong, side channel information from the circuit itself, such as power consumption, can be used
		to break the cipher. This project details the approach in executing multiple Differential Power Analysis (DPA) power-based attacks on an AES circuit while also exploring current compensation as a technique to mitigate the DPA attack.
	</p>

	<p>
		The AES core used for this project is 128-bit and follows ECB mode. 128-bit ECB mode means that there is a 128-bit input Plaintext, a 128-bit input Key, and a 128-bit input cipher text. Since it is 128-bit, it has 10 main rounds with an additional pre-round
		or round 0.
	</p>

	<p>
		Side channel attack is an attack on a system using information gained from physical implementation of a cryptosystem instead of a brute force or a theoretical weakness of the algorithm. In modern cryptographic devices, transistors are used to implement
		semiconductor logic gates which consume power and produce electromagnetic radiation. The power consumption of the integrated circuit includes the combined activity of all individual elements, capacitances, and other electrical properties. The amount
		of power consumed is highly correlated to the data being processed and thus contains information about the circuit operation. The data-dependent power usage of the cryptographic device can expose secrets that the device is processing.
