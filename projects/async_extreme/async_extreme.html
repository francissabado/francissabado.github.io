	<h2>About Project</h2>


	<p>
		The reliability of digital circuits for space applications is of utmost importance, yet problems arise because of the dramatic variances in semiconductor device behaviors due to wide temperature swings, which is very common in space. As temperature changes,
		several characteristics of a digital circuit vary accordingly, which significantly affect the circuit’s operation. Higher temperatures reduce carrier mobility, making the circuit slower, while lower temperatures increase carrier mobility, making the
		circuit faster. If the circuit is too slow, set up time will be violated since the data cannot be ready in time; if the circuit too fast, hold time will be violated since the data will change too quickly after the clock edge. Delay-insensitive asynchronous
		circuits, such as Null Convention Logic (NCL), have flexible timing requirements due to its handshaking protocol. Although the circuit speed is still affected by the temperature changes, the circuit’s operation is always valid. The functionality and
		speed of a NCL asynchronous 8031 microcontroller and its synchronous counterpart were compared under various temperatures.

		The setup was tested for the microcontrollers at -180°C, 25°C, 45°C, 85°C, and 125°C. An Altera DE2 FPGA board became an external program and data memory, sending codes to the microcontrollers and executing particular instructions and ending with a validation
		routine to verify correct program execution.
