		<h2>Project Description</h2>
		<p>Three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D-IC) technology has been
			proposed as a solution to the problems caused by the deepsubmicron
			interconnects. Consisting of multiple layers of
			interconnected planes, 3D-ICs have the benefit of shorter
			latencies and lower power consumption due to shorter wire
			lengths when compared to a single-wafer implementation.
			However, stacking active devices presents
			new design challenges, the most notable being thermal
			dissipation. When paired with a delay-insensitive asynchronous
			circuit design technique such as NULL Convention Logic (NCL),
			the two technologies unite to solve the inherent weaknesses of
			each other. As part of the 3D-IC design process, a circuit must be
			partitioned evenly between the stacked wafers. This study
			presents three strategies to split an NCL circuit into two die
			to discover the optimal partitioning method for
			asynchronous circuits. Analysis is done on total interconnect
			length, number of thru-silicon vias required, and circuit area. </p>
