		<h2>Project Description</h2>
		<p> Low power design has become an important consideration in today's electronics industry.
			The impact of power dissipation has exponentially increased as the size of transistors decrease into the nanoscale.
			This has caused a major paradigm shift where power dissipation has become as important as performance and area. </p>
		<p>	The effects of multi-finger layout technique is studied and compared terms of energy and power consumption.
			Null Convention Logic (NCL), an asynchronous design technique, is used to design a delay-insensitive full adder in multi-finger configurations.
			Cadence was used for power estimations while the simulations are setup using Virtuoso waveform analysis. The data shows the advantages of
			different multi-finger configurations for an NCL full adder circuit. </p>
