		<h2>About Project</h2>
		<p>
			Adaptive systems are characterized by their ability to evolve with their environment. With regards to control, two main categories exist: feedforward and feedback systems. In a feedforward system, the controller sends signals directly to the system to operate in a desired manner. In a feedback system, the structure sends signals indicating performance back to the controller to allow for even further adaptivity. Adaptive systems can aso be defined through their capacity to tolerate faults. There are numerous ways systems can achieve this functionality including redundancy, checkpointing, and masking. In our project the group implemented a feedforward, fault tolerant design using a hexacopter, ArduPilot, and a Nexys 4 FPGA. The hexacopter is a radio-controlled (RC) multirotor helicopter propelled by six rotors.
