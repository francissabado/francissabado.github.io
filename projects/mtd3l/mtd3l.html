		<h2>Project Description</h2>

		<p> As more sensitive data are shared, transmitted, and stored on electronic devices, data security has become an important concern.
		Encryption algorithms that are safe against software-based attacks still face security threats from side channel attacks. For example,
		an encryption device’s power consumption or operational timing can be correlated to the data being processed by the device, which can
		give away the device’s secret key. </p>
		<p> Dual-spacer Dual-rail Delay-insensitive Logic (D<span>3</span>L) is an IC design methodology that has been proved effective in mitigating power and timing attacks; however, large energy and area overheads of D<span>3</span>L circuits have hindered their applicability. In this paper an IC design methodology named Multi-Threshold D3L (MTD3L) is presented that achieves all D<span>3</span>L security advantages with considerably reduced overhead. </p>
